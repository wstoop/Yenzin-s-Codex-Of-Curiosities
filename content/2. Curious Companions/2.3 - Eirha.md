**Race**: Tabaxi (Snow Leopard)

**Role**: Warrior(?) (Former Pit Fighter)

Eirha didn’t make the best first impression. She was cold, perhaps even aggressive, when we first met. I don’t blame her, though—this place could make anyone suspicious. She quickly proved her worth in combat, demonstrating skills honed from her past as a pit fighter. Her fierce nature and combat instincts are impressive, and she was instrumental in our victory against the animated armor. While I admire her fighting prowess, I sense a deep-rooted wariness in her, likely a result of her past experiences. I’ll need to tread carefully and earn her trust.

**Trust Level**: **Medium-Low**
I trust her in a fight, but beyond that, she keeps her guard up. I’ll continue to observe her and work on building a rapport.
