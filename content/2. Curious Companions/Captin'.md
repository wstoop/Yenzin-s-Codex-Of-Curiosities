**Race**: Human(?)
**Role**: Pirate (Clown-faced)

Captin' is quite the enigma. He wears a full pirate outfit, complete with a hat, but it's mixed with elements of a clown suit. His face is completely covered by a mask, which adds an air of mystery to his persona. Despite the oddity of his appearance, he carries himself with a laid-back confidence that can be both comforting and concerning. In dire situations, he maintains a carefree attitude that feels almost too relaxed for the circumstances we find ourselves in. He fought alongside us against the animated armor, proving he can handle himself in a skirmish. While his whimsy might mask a deeper purpose, I can’t shake the feeling that there’s more to him than meets the eye.

**Trust Level**: **Low**
While his carefree nature can be disarming, I’ll remain cautious. I’ll keep an eye on him as we continue our journey.
