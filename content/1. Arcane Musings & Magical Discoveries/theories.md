## Day 1 Theories
Something powerful—and likely magical—brought me to this ancient castle. My last memory before waking up here was traveling to the library in the big city, a familiar and non-magical place. There are two possible explanations that I can think of: an enchantment of immense power was cast, or I was transported through a magical conduit.
**Speculative Questions**:
- Was I targeted specifically, or did I wander into someone else's spell?
- What connection, if any, does the fort have to this transportation?
- Was it a coincidence that the others were also affected?

For now, these are just theories. I need more evidence.
