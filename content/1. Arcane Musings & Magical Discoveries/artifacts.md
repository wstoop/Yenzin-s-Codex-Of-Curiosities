## Scroll of Crown of Stars
**Discovered**: Day 1
**Possessed by**: Yenzin
**Description**: A scroll containing the spell Crown of Stars. Scrolls of this type allow a wizard to cast the spell within, or transcribe it into their spellbook if the spell is of a level they can master.

**Personal Notes**: While Captain and Eirha found this, they entrusted me to decipher it. Once I’ve transcribed the spell, I’ll return the scroll to the group or keep it for emergencies.
