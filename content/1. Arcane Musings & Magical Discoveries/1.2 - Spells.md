## Crown of Stars
**Source**: Found in a magical scroll given to me by Captain and Eirha.

**Description**: Crown of Stars is a powerful evocation spell, summoning seven radiant motes of light that circle around the caster. These motes can be shot at enemies, dealing significant damage.

**Personal Notes**: The party trusted me to study this spell. I haven't yet transcribed it into my spellbook, but it seems like the type of magic that could turn the tide in a desperate situation. Iâ€™ll document its transcription when I get the chance to be alone.
