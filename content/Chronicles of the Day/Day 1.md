I woke up in an old, decrepit castle with no memory of how I got here. My last clear thought is heading to the library in the city, then—nothing. Something arcane is definitely at play. I need to figure out what, and who’s behind it. I’ve met some strange individuals in this situation:
[[2.2 - Vivienne|Vivienne]]: A dragon lady who looks like a mix between a tiefling and a dragonborn. She claims to be a princess and has a rather inflated ego.
[[2.3 - Eirha |Eirha]]: A snow leopard tabaxi who was pretty aggressive towards me when we first met. Still, she helped out a lot during the fight.
[[2.4 - Captin'|Captin']]: A funny clown-pirate man. He seems to be completely unfazed by the gravity of our situation.
Trust? None yet. But with no other options, I’ve stuck with them for now. During our exploration, [[2.4 - Captin'|Captin']] and [[2.3 - Eirha |Eirha]] found a magic scroll—[[1.3 - Artifacts#Scroll of Crown of Stars| Crown of Stars]]—and they handed it to me for inspection. They seem to trust me with it, which is a good sign, but I’ll need to be cautious about how I handle it moving forward. The castle seems to be guarded by animated armor. We dealt with them, but something curious happened—my Moonvale Grimoire reacted to the fight. I’ve kept that to myself for now. Until I’m sure of these people, I won’t reveal everything. Trust is earned.
