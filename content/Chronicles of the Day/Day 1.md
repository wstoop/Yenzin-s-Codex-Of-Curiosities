I woke up in an old, decrepit castle with no memory of how I got here. My last clear thought is heading to the library in the city, then—nothing. Something arcane is definitely at play. I need to figure out what, and who’s behind it. I’ve met some strange individuals in this situation:

[[2.1.1 - Vivienne|Vivienne]]: A dragon lady who looks like a mix between a tiefling and a dragonborn. She claims to be a princess and has a rather inflated ego.

[[2.1.2 - Eirha|Eirha]]: A snow leopard tabaxi who was pretty aggressive towards me when we first met. Still, she helped out a lot during the fight.

[[2.1.3 - Captin'|Captin']]: A funny clown-pirate man. He seems completely unfazed by the gravity of our situation.

Trust? None yet. But with no other options, I’ve stuck with them for now.

We found a scroll on the first floor. It seems like it was once guarded, but [[2.1.2 - Eirha|Eirha]] and [[2.1.3 - Captin'|Captin']] managed to grab it without a problem. The party gave me the scroll, so it seems I’ve garnered some trust with them. It might be wise to show the same back.

The tower was guarded by some animated armor—or at least that’s what they looked like. We managed to defeat them before they became a real threat.
