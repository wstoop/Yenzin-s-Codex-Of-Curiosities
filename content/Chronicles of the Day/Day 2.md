We just arrived in [[3.3 - Portwick|Portwick]], and something’s definitely wrong here. The whole town looks... sickly. It feels like the life is being drained out of it. The first person we ran into was a homeless dwarf named Yorvick, hanging around near the entrance. He gave us some useful info: we’re on The Isle, by the Pythodian Sea, and the nearest country is Valeria. This place is a wreck—definitely not just my imagination.

First stop: the Tuna Inn. Weird moment when the lady at the bar gave me a strange look. No clue why, but I’m keeping my eye on her.

Inside, [[2.1.3 - Captin'|Captin']], [[2.1.2 - Eirha|Eirha]], and I spotted a rich-looking tiefling. We figured we’d try our luck—someone with money to burn might be useful. Turns out, we were right. We walked away with 19 gold, which isn't too bad for a quick hustle.

Later, [[2.1.1 - Vivienne|Vivienne]], [[2.1.3 - Captin'|Captin']], and I went down to the docks looking for a magic shop. There were a few merchants, but nothing worth buying—just some rocks, half-dead fish, and an old lady selling “magic” junk. Things turned interesting when we found a strange tent. I pulled a card from the Deck of Many Things. Got the [[1.3 - Artifacts#Fates Card|Fates Card]]. No idea what to expect from that, but it could either be great... or a disaster.

[[2.1.2 - Eirha|Eirha]] mentioned a strange dream last night, but she seemed too tired to explain it clearly. There's something off about this place, more than just the creepy atmosphere.

The next day, we met the mayor. Can’t remember his name, but he didn’t seem all that impressive. He did, however, ask us to figure out why supply carts on the road to [[3.3 - Portwick|Portwick]] keep getting attacked. He was wearing this really fancy ring—looked way too important for someone like him. Something feels off about it.

We followed the lead and found these strange tree creatures. At first, they just seemed like twisted guardians of the woods, but after we dealt with them, we discovered they were being controlled by something darker—an undead creature. It said it wanted to reclaim the forest from the people of Portwick, not just for revenge, but for something sacred.

Then it demanded the mayor’s ring. Apparently, it’s tied to some god these forest spirits worship. The ring is either a key or some kind of link to their power. The mayor knows more than he’s letting on, for sure, but for now, we have to figure out how much we want to get involved in this mess between the town and the forest.

This isn’t just a local problem. It feels ancient—gods, old oaths, and who knows what else. That ring might be more dangerous than we thought. And now it’s up to us to find out the truth.
