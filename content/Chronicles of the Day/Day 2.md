We arrived in [[3.3 - Portwick|Portwick]], a small riverside town that looked sickly, like something was draining the life out of it. The first person we met was Yorvick, a homeless dwarf hanging around near the entrance. He gave us some useful info: We're on The Isle, at the coast of the Pythodian sea, and the nearest country is Valeria. [[3.3 - Portwick|Portwick]] was clearly not doing well, and this “sickly” vibe wasn’t just my imagination.

Our first stop was the Tuna Inn, where I noticed the lady at the bar giving me a weird look. Not sure why, but I'll keep an eye on her.

Inside the tavern, [[2.4 - Captin' |Captin']], [[2.3 - Eirha |Eirha]], and I decided to try our luck with a rich-looking tiefling. She looked like someone with money to burn, and she did. We managed to walk away with 19 gold.

[Vivienne](Vivienne), [Captin'](Captin') and I went to the docks in search of a magic shop. There were a few merchants around, but they weren't selling anything worthwhile—rocks, near-dead fish, and an old lady with some "magic" junk. We did find a weird tent where I ended up with a card from the Deck of Many Things, more specifically the[[1.3 - Artifacts#Fates Card | fates card]]. That could be interesting... or dangerous.

 [[2.3 - Eirha |Eirha]] had some sort of strange dream or vision last night, but she was too tired to recall much of it. Feels like there's more going on here than meets the eye.

The next day, we eventually met the mayor. Unfortunately, I can't remember his name, but he didn't leave much of an impression anyway. He did, however, task us with figuring out why the supply carts on the road to [[3.3 - Portwick|Portwick]] kept getting attacked. There was something about him—he wore a fancy-looking ring that seemed way too important for someone like him. Still, a job’s a job.

Following the lead brought us to these strange, living tree creatures. At first, they just seemed like twisted woodland guardians, but once we dealt with them, we found out they were being controlled by something darker—an undead monstrosity, some shadowy being. It wanted to reclaim the forest from the people of Portwick, not just for revenge, but for something sacred.

The creature demanded that we bring it the mayor's ring. Apparently, the ring is important to the god these forest spirits worship—maybe a link, or a key to their power. The mayor definitely knows more than he’s telling us, but for now, we have to decide how much we want to get involved in this struggle between the town and the forest.

We’re caught in the middle of something old and tangled with gods and forgotten oaths. That ring might be far more dangerous than it looks, and it seems we’re the only ones who can find out the truth.
