We’ve had a hectic day. [[2.1.1 - Vivienne|Vivienne]] and I explored Portwick’s library—if you can call it that—and struck gold. Among the dusty shelves, we unearthed a book on local legends. It detailed a circle of druids who once thrived here, using the now-claimed forest’s restorative powers. Another text spoke of [[3.2 - Old Fort Skara|Old Fort Skara]], hinting at its dark history. I felt something stir in me, as if these stories were a piece of something bigger I can’t quite place.

Meanwhile, [[2.1.3 - Captin'|Captin']] and [[2.1.2 - Eirha|Eirha]] caused a commotion in the square, gathering a crowd under the guise of collecting information and donations. Typical. Somehow, the chaos worked in our favor, and the mayor actually entertained us.

[[2.1.1 - Vivienne|Vivienne]] managed to charm the story of his ring out of him. It’s tied to the woods—and to his late wife, who vanished seeking its supposed healing properties. With some persuasion (credit where it’s due, [[2.1.3 - Captin'|Captin']]), we convinced him to give us the ring. I thought this would end things peacefully. I was wrong.

We delivered the ring to [[2.2.1 - Maryk|Maryk]], the undead figure pulling the strings behind the forest. He talked cryptically, of revenge and restoration, but it was clear he wouldn’t stop starving [[3.3 - Portwick|Portwick]] of resources. That left us no choice but to fight.

The battle was brutal—Undead abominations,  twisted forest magic, and exhaustion nearly did us in. And then, as the tide finally turned, a vampire-like figure emerged. He seized the ring and vanished before we could react. This isn’t over.
