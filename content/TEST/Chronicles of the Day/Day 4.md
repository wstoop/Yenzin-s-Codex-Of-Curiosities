We returned to [[3.2.1 - Old Fort Skara|Old Fort Skara]], seeking answers and perhaps a way to undo the vampire’s damage. The fort felt alive, almost like it was waiting for us. Deep inside, we discovered a staircase leading to a hidden basement.

There, we faced an odd challenge—a mimic disguised as a barrel. After defeating it, we encountered animated armor once again, guarding a ritual site. In the center of the room, two towering knight statues stood: one wreathed in flames, the other dripping water. Behind them, an ominous ritual circle pulsed with energy.

My Moonvale Grimoire reacted instantly, snapping from my hands and floating above the circle like it belonged there. Whatever magic powered this ritual seemed connected to my tome. Desperate to reclaim it, I pushed the party forward, and we clashed with the armor.

Amid the chaos, [[2.1.1 - Vivienne|Vivienne]] discovered a hidden room containing a unique dagger, its design unlike anything we’d seen before. As for me, I retrieved the Grimoire, but it’s changed. I don’t know how, but it feels… awake.
