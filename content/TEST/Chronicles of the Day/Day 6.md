We left [[3.1.1 - Meris|Meris]] for the [[3.1.3 - Library Invocatus|Library Invocatus]], but our journey was interrupted near a bridge leading to the library. Guards stationed there prevented anyone with memory loss from crossing. It seemed the magic was designed specifically to bar those without their pasts from entering.

[[2.1.3 - Captin'|Captin']] quickly volunteered to swim to a nearby lighthouse and disable it, but the waters were treacherous, and he needed [[2.3.2 - Hasinne|Hasinne]]’s water-breathing potions to safely make the journey. Hasinne agreed to brew the potions in exchange for doing some testing on [[2.1.3 - Captin'|Captin]], though it’s unclear what exactly he was trying to learn. The trade worked out—[[2.1.3 - Captin'|Captin]] made it to the lighthouse, disabled it, and allowed us to commandeer a boat, bypassing both the bridge and the guards.

While we managed to get around the obstacle, the memory-blocking magic only added to the growing tension. It felt like we were on the verge of something important, but the more we uncovered, the more questions arose.
