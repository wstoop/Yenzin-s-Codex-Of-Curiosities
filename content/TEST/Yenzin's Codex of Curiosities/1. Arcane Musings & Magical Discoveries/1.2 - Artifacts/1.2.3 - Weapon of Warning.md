**Discovered**: Day 2  
**Possessed by**: [[2.1.2 - Eirha|Eirha]]

**Description**: A finely crafted weapon that vibrates with a sense of impending danger. The Weapon of Warning grants [[2.1.2 - Eirha|Eirha]] heightened awareness in battle, alerting her to danger before it strikes. This ensures that she can react swiftly and decisively, giving her an edge over her foes.

**Personal Notes**: We managed to persuade the mayor to let us choose one magic item from the treasury in exchange for dealing with whatever's blocking the road. [[2.1.2 - Eirha|Eirha's]] instincts are already sharp, but this will make her even more formidable in combat. I can already picture her cutting down enemies before they even realize theyâ€™ve been targeted.
