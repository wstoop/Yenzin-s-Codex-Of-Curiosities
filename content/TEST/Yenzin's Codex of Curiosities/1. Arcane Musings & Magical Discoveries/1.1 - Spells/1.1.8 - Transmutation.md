## Feather Fall
**Source**: Learned from an old grimoire passed down through my grandparents.

**Description**: This spell allows myself and my companions to float gently to the ground, as if cradled by ethereal feathers—ideal for when a jump turns into an unexpected descent.

**Personal Notes**: I can envision this spell preventing quite a few unfortunate tumbles during my escapades. Safety first—no one wishes to encounter a bruised gnome!

## Maximilian's Earthen Grasp
**Source**: Found in an ancient tome of elemental magic, it speaks of the primal forces that bind the earth.

**Description**: I call upon the earth to form a massive hand that rises from the ground, seizing my enemy in its stone grip, as if the very earth itself seeks to hold them fast.

**Personal Notes**: There’s something deeply satisfying about using the earth’s strength to restrain a foe. It’s both a display of raw power and a subtle way to control the battlefield without much effort
