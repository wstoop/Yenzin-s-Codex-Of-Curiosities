Kallix is a human blacksmith who recently joined our extended group. He’s a skilled craftsman, but I have serious reservations about one of his ideas—mass-producing flintlock guns. The concept itself is troubling, both from a moral and a practical standpoint. Such weapons, in the hands of the wrong people, could cause untold damage, and the thought of making them available to the masses is unsettling.

I understand the appeal of innovation, but this feels like a step in the wrong direction. There’s no telling what consequences this could bring, especially if such weapons fall into the wrong hands. I’m not sure how much I can trust someone so eager to weaponize technology, but for now, he’s part of the group, whether I like it or not.
