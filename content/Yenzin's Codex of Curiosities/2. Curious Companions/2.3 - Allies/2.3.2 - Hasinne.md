Hasinne is a traveling merchant with a peculiar appearance—he looks more like a machine than a man, as if his flesh has been replaced by mechanical parts. There’s a cold, almost unsettling air about him, and despite his humanoid form, there’s something distinctly unnatural in the way he moves and speaks. His gear seems highly advanced, and it’s unclear whether he’s human at all or some sort of construct, though he seems to have all the mannerisms of a seasoned merchant.

He always seems to show up when we enter a new city, and his goods range from mundane trinkets to far more arcane items. But there’s more to Hasinne than meets the eye—his true purpose and allegiances remain a mystery. We’ve exchanged favors before, though I can’t help but wonder what his endgame is. He’s always looking for new information, testing things, and pushing his wares on anyone who will listen.

Despite his oddities, Hasinne’s potions and tools have proven useful—his water-breathing potions, for instance, were invaluable when [[2.1.3 - Captin'|Captin]] swam to the lighthouse. Yet I can't shake the feeling that we’re part of some larger puzzle he’s assembling.
