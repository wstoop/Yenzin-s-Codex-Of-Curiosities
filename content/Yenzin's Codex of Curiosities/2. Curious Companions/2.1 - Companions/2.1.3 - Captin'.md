**Race**: Clown

**Role**: Pirate/ Rogue

Captin’ is an oddity, even by the standards of our ragtag group. He wears a full pirate ensemble, yet it’s unmistakably paired with elements of a clown suit—complete with a mask that conceals his face partially. he has 1 ruby eye that isn't covered by his mask. His appearance might seem eccentric, but there’s a confidence in the way he carries himself that’s both unsettling and oddly reassuring. Despite his flamboyant, carefree nature, he has proven his skill in battle, fighting alongside us against the animated armor without hesitation. What’s more curious is his backstory. Captin’ is a clown—spawned from the remains of an entertainer. He loathes undeath, yet it they seem like relatives. This paradox only adds to the enigma he presents. While his levity can mask his true intentions, I can’t ignore the depth of his character and the unpredictable ways he approaches problems.

***Trust Level**: **Medium**  
I’ve grown to trust Captin’ more since we’ve been traveling together. His ability to stay calm under pressure, along with his surprising effectiveness in battle, makes him a reliable, if unpredictable, ally. But given his "undead" nature, I still feel there’s much I don’t understand about him.
