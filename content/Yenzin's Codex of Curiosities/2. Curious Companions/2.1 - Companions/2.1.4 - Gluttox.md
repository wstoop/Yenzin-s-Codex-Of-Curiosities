**Race**: Psuedodragon  
**Role**: Familiar / Scout

Gluttox is Vivienne’s trusty psuedodragon companion, a small, chubby creature with a spiked ball tail that often wags with excitement. While his appearance is endearing, he is far from a mere pet. Gluttox has the uncanny ability to communicate both telepathically and by mimicking speech, often adding a playful or sarcastic touch to the conversation. He has proven useful as both a scout and a sounding board for Vivienne, though his loyalty to her is unwavering. His mischievous nature can sometimes be a bit distracting, but his sharp instincts and unique abilities make him an irreplaceable ally.

**Trust Level**: **NA**  
As Gluttox primarily follows Vivienne’s lead, I don’t feel the need to evaluate his trustworthiness. For now, his loyalty is unquestioned, and I see him as a useful ally.
