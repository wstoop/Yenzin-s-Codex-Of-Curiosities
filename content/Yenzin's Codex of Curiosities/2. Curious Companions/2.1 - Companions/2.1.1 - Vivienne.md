![[Vivienne.png | 200]]

**Race**: Half Dragon

**Role**: Summoner / Mage

Vivienne is quite the character. She presents herself as a princess, but hasn’t revealed her true lineage, and her appearance leans more toward that of a Tiefling. Her confidence is evident, but it borders on arrogance. To my surprise, she displayed magical abilities, summoning a kobold to assist in our recent battle against the animated armor. This skill adds a new layer to her character; she’s not just a self-declared noble but a capable spellcaster as well. While her ego might be off-putting, there's no denying the potential she brings to our group. I'll have to keep an eye on her, both to gauge her true nature and to see how her magic evolves.

**Trust Level**: **Medium-High**
I’m cautiously optimistic. Her magic could prove invaluable, but I’ll remain vigilant.

Vivienne and I share a mutual respect for the arcane, and I’ve seen enough of her magical prowess to trust her judgment in our pursuits. While I still maintain a watchful eye on her, the trust between us is growing. I’ll continue to observe how her magic evolves and how it can benefit our group.
