**Race**: Tabaxi (Snow Leopard)

**Role**: Sword bard (Former Pit Fighter)

Eirha didn’t make the best first impression. She was cold, perhaps even aggressive, when we first met. I don’t blame her, though—this place could make anyone suspicious. She quickly proved her worth in combat, demonstrating skills honed from her past as a pit fighter. Her fierce nature and combat instincts are impressive, and she was instrumental in our victory against the animated armor. While I admire her fighting prowess, I sense a deep-rooted wariness in her, likely a result of her past experiences. I’ll need to tread carefully and earn her trust.

During downtime, Eirha sometimes sketches, though it doesn’t seem to carry much deeper meaning for her. I’ve learned that she used to create murals in her hometown, and these drawings are more of a way to keep her connection to her past alive. It’s not about the art itself, but about remembering where she comes from. The sketches are her quiet way of holding on to the home she left behind.

I’ve started to include these small sketches in my own journals—they serve as a window into her past, and perhaps one day, they’ll help me understand her better. For now, I’ll continue to work on building trust, though I know it may take time before she truly lets her guard down.

**Trust Level**: **Medium**
I trust her in a fight, but beyond that, she keeps her guard up. I’ll continue to observe her and work on building a rapport.

I’m beginning to understand her better. Her effectiveness in battle is unquestionable, and while she still keeps her distance, I’ve seen enough to know she’s loyal to the group. I’ll continue to work on building a better rapport.
