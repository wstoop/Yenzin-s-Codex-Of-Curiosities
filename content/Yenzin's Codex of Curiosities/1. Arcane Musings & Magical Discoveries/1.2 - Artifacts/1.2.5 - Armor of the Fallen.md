**Discovered**: Day 3  
**Possessed by**: [[2.1.1 - Vivienne|Vivienne]]

**Description**: This armor is imbued with the spirits of those who have fallen in battle, granting it unique protective qualities. The armor has some magical properties to it as well, but I haven't had the time to decipher which ones exactly.

**Personal Notes**: We managed to persuade the mayor to let us choose one magic item from the treasury in exchange for dealing with whatever's blocking the road. With its enchantments and the history it carries, I believe it will empower [[2.1.1 - Vivienne|Vivienne]] in ways we can’t yet comprehend. She’ll be a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.
