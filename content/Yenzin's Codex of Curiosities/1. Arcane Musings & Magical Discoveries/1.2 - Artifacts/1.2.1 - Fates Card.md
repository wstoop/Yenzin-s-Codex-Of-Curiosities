**Discovered**: Day 2

**Possessed by**: Yenzin

**Description**: A card drawn from the infamous Deck of Many Things. This particular card, known as the Fates Card, is rumored to have the power to alter destiny itself. When used, it allows the holder to erase a single event from their past or present, effectively rewriting fate. However, the exact nature of this change is unpredictable and could come with unintended consequences.

**Personal Notes**: I obtained the Fates Card from a strange tent at the docks. The group is aware of its power, and we all understand the risks involved. I’ll hold onto it for now, but we need to decide carefully if and when we use it—power over fate is not something to take lightly.
