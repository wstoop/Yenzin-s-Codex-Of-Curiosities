**Discovered**: Day 2

**Possessed by**: Yenzin

**Description**: This is no ordinary spellbook—it's a leather-bound tome of incredible power. The Arcane Grimoire serves as both a spellcasting focus and a spellbook, granting me a boost to my spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of my spells. The strength of this bonus depends on the rarity of the grimoire, which I believe is uncommon—I'll need to confirm that later.

Beyond enhancing my magic, this grimoire also amplifies my Arcane Recovery, allowing me to regain an extra spell slot level when I need it most. This could prove invaluable in the challenges ahead.

**Personal Notes**: We managed to persuade the mayor to let us choose one magic item from the treasury in exchange for dealing with whatever's blocking the road. This grimoire was my choice, and I think it will give me the edge I need to tackle whatever danger lies ahead. It’s a rare find, and I’m determined to make the most of it. The mayor is counting on us, and I won’t let him down.
