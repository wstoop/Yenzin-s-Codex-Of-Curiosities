**Discovered**: Day 2  
**Possessed by**: [[2.1.3 - Captin'|Captin']]

**Description**: These sleek, black gloves enhance the wearer’s dexterity and stealth abilities. The Gloves of Thievery provide [[2.1.3 - Captin'|Captin']] with a bonus to sleight of hand and other skills related to stealth and thievery, making him even more elusive and effective when sneaking around.

**Personal Notes**: We managed to persuade the mayor to let us choose one magic item from the treasury in exchange for dealing with whatever's blocking the road. With [[2.1.3 - Captin'|Captin's]] natural talent for stealth, I can only imagine what he’ll be capable of now. They’ll be invaluable for scouting ahead and getting the drop on our enemies.
