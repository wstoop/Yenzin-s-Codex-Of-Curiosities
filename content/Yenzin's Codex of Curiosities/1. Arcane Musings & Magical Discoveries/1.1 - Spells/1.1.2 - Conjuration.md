## Find Familiar
**Source**: Discovered in an old tome of ritual magic.

**Description**: By performing a ritual, I summon a spirit in the form of a small animal to serve as my companion. The familiar can aid in scouting, spellcasting, and communication, forming a deep bond with me.

**Personal Notes**: The familiar’s form should reflect my nature—perhaps a sharp-eyed owl or a clever cat. It’s an extension of myself, both a magical tool and a trusted ally.
