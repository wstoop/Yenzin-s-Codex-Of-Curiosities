## Scroll of Crown of Stars
**Discovered**: Day 1

**Possessed by**: Yenzin

**Description**: A scroll containing the spell Crown of Stars. Scrolls of this type allow a wizard to cast the spell within, or transcribe it into their spellbook if the spell is of a level they can master.

**Personal Notes**: While [[2.4 - Captin'|Captin']] and [[2.3 - Eirha|Eirha]] found this, they entrusted me to decipher it. Once I’ve transcribed the spell, I’ll return the scroll to the group or keep it for emergencies.

## Fates Card
**Discovered**: Day 2

**Possessed by**: Yenzin

**Description**: A card drawn from the infamous Deck of Many Things. This particular card, known as the Fates Card, is rumored to have the power to alter destiny itself. When used, it allows the holder to erase a single event from their past or present, effectively rewriting fate. However, the exact nature of this change is unpredictable and could come with unintended consequences.

**Personal Notes**: I obtained the Fates Card from a strange tent at the docks. The group is aware of its power, and we all understand the risks involved. I’ll hold onto it for now, but we need to decide carefully if and when we use it—power over fate is not something to take lightly.

## Arcane Grimoire
**Discovered**: Day 2

**Possessed by**: Yenzin

**Description**: This is no ordinary spellbook—it's a leather-bound tome of incredible power. The Arcane Grimoire serves as both a spellcasting focus and a spellbook, granting me a boost to my spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of my spells. The strength of this bonus depends on the rarity of the grimoire, which I believe is uncommon—I'll need to confirm that later.

Beyond enhancing my magic, this grimoire also amplifies my Arcane Recovery, allowing me to regain an extra spell slot level when I need it most. This could prove invaluable in the challenges ahead.

**Personal Notes**: We managed to persuade the mayor to let us choose one magic item from the treasury in exchange for dealing with whatever's blocking the road. This grimoire was my choice, and I think it will give me the edge I need to tackle whatever danger lies ahead. It’s a rare find, and I’m determined to make the most of it. The mayor is counting on us, and I won’t let him down.

## Weapon of Warning
**Discovered**: Day 2  
**Possessed by**: [[2.3 - Eirha|Eirha]]

**Description**: A finely crafted weapon that vibrates with a sense of impending danger. The Weapon of Warning grants [[2.3 - Eirha|Eirha]] heightened awareness in battle, alerting her to danger before it strikes. This ensures that she can react swiftly and decisively, giving her an edge over her foes.

**Personal Notes**: We managed to persuade the mayor to let us choose one magic item from the treasury in exchange for dealing with whatever's blocking the road. [[2.3 - Eirha|Eirha's]] instincts are already sharp, but this will make her even more formidable in combat. I can already picture her cutting down enemies before they even realize they’ve been targeted.

## Gloves of Thievery
**Discovered**: Day 2  
**Possessed by**: [[2.4 - Captin'|Captin']]

**Description**: These sleek, black gloves enhance the wearer’s dexterity and stealth abilities. The Gloves of Thievery provide [[2.4 - Captin'|Captin']] with a bonus to sleight of hand and other skills related to stealth and thievery, making him even more elusive and effective when sneaking around.

**Personal Notes**: We managed to persuade the mayor to let us choose one magic item from the treasury in exchange for dealing with whatever's blocking the road. With [[2.4 - Captin'|Captin's]] natural talent for stealth, I can only imagine what he’ll be capable of now. They’ll be invaluable for scouting ahead and getting the drop on our enemies.

## Armor of the Fallen
**Discovered**: Day 3  
**Possessed by**: [[2.2 - Vivienne|Vivienne]]

**Description**: This armor is imbued with the spirits of those who have fallen in battle, granting it unique protective qualities. The armor has some magical properties to it as well, but I haven't had the time to decipher which ones exactly.

**Personal Notes**: We managed to persuade the mayor to let us choose one magic item from the treasury in exchange for dealing with whatever's blocking the road. With its enchantments and the history it carries, I believe it will empower [[2.2 - Vivienne|Vivienne]] in ways we can’t yet comprehend. She’ll be a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.
