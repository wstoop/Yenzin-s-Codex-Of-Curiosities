**Location**: The Isle, at the coast of the Pythodian sea

**Significance**:  First town we found

## Description:
A small riverside town shrouded in desolation, its buildings leaning as if weary from an unseen weight. The air is thick with an oppressive silence, interrupted only by the distant sound of waves lapping against the shore. Once a thriving settlement, its crumbling stone and rotting wood bear testament to a time of prosperity long past. Shadows linger in the fog that creeps through the narrow streets, whispering tales of forgotten lives and lost hopes.
## Notable Features:
- **The Tuna Inn**: This rustic tavern serves as the heart of Portwick, a solitary refuge for the few weary souls who venture here. The innkeeper wasn't too friendly. She looked at me with a cautions gaze, almost like she knows me.

- **The Docks**: Once a bustling hub for trade, the docks now serve as a market, with makeshift stalls set up by desperate merchants peddling their wares. The air is tinged with the scent of brine and decay, and vendors call out to passersby, selling anything from fish to trinkets.
## Personal Notes:
- Portwick feels like a ghost town, with its emptiness pressing down on me. The lingering unease and the occasional furtive glances from the townsfolk suggest there are deeper mysteries here. The mayor, with his important ring and vague demeanor, is clearly hiding something. I must remain vigilant; it is clear that we are not the only ones interested in the fate of this place.
