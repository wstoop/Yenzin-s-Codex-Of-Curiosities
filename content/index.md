title: Yenzin’s Tome of Travels – Introduction
---
**Greetings, curious mind,**

If you’ve found yourself reading these pages, it means one of two things: either you've happened upon my most valuable possession by chance or, far more troubling, I’ve been careless enough to misplace it. In either case, welcome to the life and travels of Yenzin Moonvale, self though scholar of the arcane.

This is no ordinary collection of notes. Contained within these pages I record my daily encounters, thoughts, and experiences, all meticulously documented for the discerning reader, or perhaps for the unfortunate soul who might dare to follow in my footsteps.

The first chapter serves as a daily log, capturing the ebb and flow of each day’s events, from the mundane to the magical. Whether it's a fleeting thought or a significant encounter, every detail finds its place in these entries.

Then there’s the _Codex of Curiosities_—the true heart of this tome. This section is dedicated to documenting the people, creatures, and peculiarities I’ve encountered on my journey. Whether trusted allies or dangerous rivals, their stories are now documented and kept well within the pages of this chapter.

Why do I record all this? Knowledge is power, and power is best wielded by those who prepare. I document not only to preserve my insights but to offer them, perhaps someday, as a guide for those bold enough to seek the mysteries of this world.

As you read, remember: **Trust no one, and question everything.**

Here begins the tale of my strange journey. May it intrigue you as much as it has perplexed me.
