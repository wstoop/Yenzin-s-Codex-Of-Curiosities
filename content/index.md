title: Yenzin’s Codex of Curiosities – Introduction
---

**Greetings, curious mind,**

If you’ve found yourself reading these pages, you’ve either stumbled upon my most treasured possession or, more concerningly, I’ve misplaced it. Whatever the case may be, welcome to the life and chronicles of Yenzin, the gnome wizard of far-reaching intellect and the occasional questionable decision.

Contained within this Codex are my personal notes, thoughts, discoveries, and observations from my journey. It’s a record of the strange and arcane, the curious and the dangerous, all documented for posterity or, perhaps, for someone else brave (or foolish) enough to follow in my footsteps.

I’m not one to trust easily, but the people I’ve met along the way have earned a place in these notes. For better or worse, they now form part of my adventure. They may be helpful allies or prove themselves otherwise. Time will tell. Either way, their stories intertwine with mine.

This book serves as a detailed account of my journey, highlighting not just the places and people I've encountered, but the insights and mysteries I've uncovered. You'll find entries that reflect my keen eye for magic and the unknown—no stone left unturned, no enigma ignored. Everything from the mundane to the extraordinary will be chronicled with my signature gnomish precision.

Why? Simple: Knowledge is power. And I intend to collect as much as I can.

Perhaps, someday, this Codex will serve as a guide to others—whether to retrace my steps or avoid my mistakes. Either way, take this as a humble offering of insight and curiosity. But remember: **Trust no one, and question everything.**

Here begins the tale of my strange journey. May you find it as fascinating as I have lived it.
