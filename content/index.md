title: Yenzin’s Codex of Curiosities – Introduction
---
**Greetings, curious mind,**

If you’ve found yourself reading these pages, it means one of two things: either you've happened upon my most valuable possession by chance or, far more troubling, I’ve been careless enough to misplace it. In either case, welcome to the life and travels of Yenzin Moonvale, gnome wizard of keen intellect, relentless curiosity, and, on occasion, dubious decision-making.

This is no ordinary collection of notes. Contained within these pages, now aptly named _Yenzin’s Tome of Travels_, lies the account of my journey through the strange and arcane, the perilous and the profound. Here, I record my daily encounters, thoughts, and experiences, all meticulously documented for the discerning reader, or perhaps for the unfortunate soul who might dare to follow in my footsteps.

The _Chronicles of the Day_ serve as a daily log, capturing the ebb and flow of each day’s events, from the mundane to the magical. Whether it's a fleeting thought or a significant encounter, every detail finds its place in these entries. It’s a ritual of reflection, a practice to both ground me in the present and remind me of the perils of complacency.

Then there’s the _Codex of Curiosities_—the true heart of this tome. This section is dedicated to documenting the people, creatures, and peculiarities I’ve encountered on my journey. Those who have earned a place in these pages are not simply companions; they are key players in the unfolding story. Whether trusted allies or dangerous rivals, their stories are now intertwined with mine, for better or for worse.

Why do I record all this? Knowledge is power, and power is best wielded by those who prepare. No enigma ignored, no arcane secret left unexplored. I document not only to preserve my insights but to offer them, perhaps someday, as a guide for those bold enough to seek the mysteries of this world.

As you read, remember: **Trust no one, and question everything.**

Here begins the tale of my strange journey. May you find it as intriguing to read as I have found it to live.
